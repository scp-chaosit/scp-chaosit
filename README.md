# Hello
### I'm ordinary, starting programmer. I want to support open-source projects, because I'm using Arch Linux, and I don't like proprietary soft.
### Okay, what I want from my live? What programming languages I want to learn?

1. C-like languages:
    1. C
    2. C++
    3. Java
    4. JavaScript
    5. TypeScript
2. Languages for web developement:
    1. HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
    2. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
3. Scripting language for Unix - bash
4. A few libraries and frameworks:
    1. Spring (for Java)
    2. Express js with node js (for JavaScript. And yeah, I know what node js is not library or framework! Express is useless without node js!)
    3. React (for JavaScript)
    4. Bootstrap (for CSS)
